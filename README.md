# MAPI.rs

### What is it?
MAPI.rs is a [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) library that lets you perform system monitorization tasks. For instance, there is a function for retrieving all files on a system. To do this, import this library into your project, then call `get_files_count()`.

This project is a fork of [MAPI](https://github.com/naltun/mapi), a Ru{st|by} FFI project, with all Ruby files removed. This was done so that I can use this library as a git submodule across various projects. This repository will probably be submoduled into MAPI.

This code is largely experimental, and is written by an aspiring Rustacean. That being said, I am definitely a Rust novice. Any advice || pull requests are welcome.
